# 🔥 U.S. Wildfire Trends & Risk Visualization Project

## 🧠 Project Objective
This project uses data over the past year to explore wildfire trends in the United States to understand:
- When wildfires are most likely to occur (seasonal patterns)
- Which states and regions are most affected
- The overall impact in terms of frequency, damage, and potential risk

The goal is to create an interactive, visual tool that helps users:
- Identify wildfire-prone states based on time of year
- Understand how wildfire patterns shift month-to-month
- Eventually, estimate the risk of wildfires in specific regions

---

## 🗺️ Long-Term Vision
- A map of the U.S. with a **time slider or dropdown** (Jan–Dec)
- **States change color** based on wildfire likelihood during the selected month
- Supporting **charts and graphs** for additional insight (e.g., top 5 states by fire count)
- (Future) Add other disaster types (floods, hurricanes, etc.)
- (Future) Add a prediction model to estimate wildfire risk

## 🧱 Phase 1: Data Analysis & Visualization (Current Phase)
### 🔍 Focus:
- Work only with wildfires for now
- Use the dataset to answer questions like:
  - What months have the most wildfires?
  - Which states experience wildfires most frequently?
  - Are wildfires increasing over time?
  - (If possible) Which states experience the highest damage or fatalities?

### 🛠 Tools:
- Python + Pandas (core)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for charts)
- GeoPandas or Plotly / Folium (for maps — later in Phase 1)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub for version control

## 🧭 What This Project Is NOT (Yet)
- No machine learning models for now (prediction comes later)
- No dashboard just yet (will consider Streamlit/Dash after the base map works)
- No multiple disaster types (we’re starting with just wildfires to learn and build a solid structure)

---

## ✅ Why This Project?
- To improve my data analysis and visualization skills
- To apply what I'm learning from Codecademy in a real-world context
- To build a project that’s insightful, useful, and expandable
